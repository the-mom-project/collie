    Parameters
    ----------
    positive_scores: torch.tensor, 1-d
        Tensor containing scores for known positive items or users of shape
        ``num_negative_samples x batch_size``
    many_negative_scores: torch.tensor, 2-d
        Iterable of tensors containing scores for many (n > 1) sampled negative items or users of
        shape ``num_negative_samples x batch_size``. More tensors increase the likelihood of finding
        ranking-violating pairs, but risk overfitting
    num_ids: int
        Total number of either item IDs or user IDs in the dataset
    positive_ids: torch.tensor, 1-d
        Tensor containing IDs for known positive items or users of shape
        ``num_negative_samples x batch_size``. This is only needed if ``metadata`` is provided
    negative_ids: torch.tensor, 2-d
        Tensor containing IDs for sampled negative items or users of shape
        ``num_negative_samples x batch_size``. This is only needed if ``metadata`` is provided
    metadata: dict
        Keys should be strings identifying each metadata type that match keys in
        ``metadata_weights``. Values should be a ``torch.tensor`` of shape (num_ids x 1). Each
        tensor should contain categorical metadata information about items or users (e.g. a number
        representing the genre of the item)
    metadata_weights: dict
        Keys should be strings identifying each metadata type that match keys in ``metadata``.
        Values should be the amount of weight to place on a match of that type of metadata, with the
        sum of all values ``<= 1``.
        e.g. If ``metadata_weights = {'genre': .3, 'director': .2}``, then an item is:

        * a 100% match if it's the same item,

        * a 50% match if it's a different item with the same genre and same director,

        * a 30% match if it's a different item with the same genre and different director,

        * a 20% match if it's a different item with a different genre and same director,

        * a 0% match if it's a different item with a different genre and different director,
          which is equivalent to the loss without any partial credit
